# Friendly Neighborhood Mobile App
This repository is hosted as a part of FSI Hackathon for Autism (https://github.com/fsi-hack4autism)

## Objective: Connect parents of children with ASD with helpful resources in the community - other parents, BCBAs, organizations, etc.
When parents move into a new neighborhood, they are not sure what local resources are available to help them or their child. They don't know which RBT, BCBA, or ABA therapist will be best suited for their child. Often times, parents don't even know what questions to ask or what benefits are available to them. This app attempts to start solving the problem.

### Sample Scenarios
This mobile app will help connect parents and patients with other helpful members of the community - other parents, BCBAs, organizations, etc. It will work in three main phases
* Intake
  * Allow patients and parents to fill in their and thier child's profile
  * Offer a helpful "onbording survey" that will gather basic information about their child
* Discover
  * Use ChatGPT to allow parents and patients ask open ended questions and have a conversation
  * Prompt the right next actions for the parents 
  * Provide helpful information from credible sources
* Connect
  * Connect them with other parents in same situation
  * Connect them with credible resources and organizations that offer help in the specific area they are looking for
